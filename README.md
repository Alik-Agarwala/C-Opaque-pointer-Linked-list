# Implementation of linked list using opaque pointer in C

This repository showcases an implementation of a linked list using the `opaque pointer` concept in the `C` programming language. It consists of three files:

- `linkedList.h`: This is the header file that contains the declarations of the functions and data structures used in the linked list implementation.
- `linkedList.c`: This file contains the actual implementation of the linked list functions defined in the header file.
- `main.c`: This is the driver code that demonstrates how to use the linked list functions.

### > How to compile & run

- Clone the repo.
- Go inside the `Linked List` directory.
- Compile with `gcc linkedList.c main.c`.
- Run with `./a.out` (Linux environment) or `.\a.exe` (Windows environment).
